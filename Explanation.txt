PROJECT 1 (INTERNSHIP PROGRAM)

UNDERSTANDING MVC (VERY SIMPLE)

MVC stands for:

Model – View – Controller

MVC is a way to organize your project so that:

Code is easy to understand

Each file has one clear job

The project is easy to grow in the future

MODEL (M)

What is Model?

Model is related to the database

It decides how data is stored

What Model does:

Creates the structure of data (schema)

Talks to the database

Fetches, saves, updates, and deletes data

Example database actions:
User.find()
User.create()
User.updateOne()

Simple meaning:
"Model knows everything about the database."

CONTROLLER (C)

What is Controller?

Controller is the brain of the app

What Controller does:

Gets request from the user

Asks the Model for data

Sends response back to the user

Simple example:
export const login = async (req, res) => {
const user = await User.findOne({ email });
if (!user) return res.status(404);
res.json(user);
};

Simple meaning:
"Controller decides what to do when a request comes."

VIEW (V)

What is View?

View is what the user sees

View in backend:

JSON data

API responses

View in frontend:

Web pages

React / HTML / CSS

Simple meaning:
"View shows the result to the user."

BASIC PROJECT FILE STRUCTURE

src/
├── config/
│ └── db.js => connects MongoDB with the project
├── models/
│ └── user.model.js => user data structure (schema)
├── controllers/
│ └── user.controller.js => main logic for user actions
├── routes/
│ └── user.routes.js => defines URLs like /login, /register
├── middleware/
│ └── auth.middleware.js => checks user login and token
├── app.js => sets up Express app
└── server.js => starts the server

HOW A REQUEST WORKS (STEP BY STEP)

User opens website or app

User sends request (example: login)

Route matches the URL

Middleware checks authentication

Controller runs logic

Model talks to database

Controller gets data back

Response is sent to user (View)

REAL LIFE EXAMPLE (FOOD ORDER)

User => Customer
Route => Waiter
Controller => Kitchen Manager
Model => Kitchen / Store Room
View => Food served on the table
